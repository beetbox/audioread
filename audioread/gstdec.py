"""Use Gstreamer to decode audio files.

To read an audio file, pass it to the constructor for GstAudioFile()
and then iterate over the contents:

    >>> f = GstAudioFile('something.mp3')
    >>> try:
    >>>     for block in f:
    >>>         ...
    >>> finally:
    >>>     f.close()

Note that there are a few complications caused by Gstreamer's
asynchronous architecture. This module spawns its own Gobject main-
loop thread; I'm not sure how that will interact with other main
loops if your program has them. Also, in order to stop the thread
and terminate your program normally, you need to call the close()
method on every GstAudioFile you create. Conveniently, the file can be
used as a context manager to make this simpler:

    >>> with GstAudioFile('something.mp3') as f:
    >>>     for block in f:
    >>>         ...

Iterating a GstAudioFile yields strings containing short integer PCM
data. You can also read the sample rate and channel count from the
file:

    >>> with GstAudioFile('something.mp3') as f:
    >>>     print f.samplerate
    >>>     print f.channels
    >>>     print f.duration
